<h4>REQUEST - Example websocket API request to send, receive messages</h4>

}
<br><br>

The "messages" field will send each message to the pertinent device, according to the 'device' field (technically defined as, having split the message into sections by the semicolons, the first section entirely made up of numbers.)<br>

The "subscriptions" field will track your subscriptions each time you send the field. the server will forward every message that the devices in the list send, to you the subscriber. Note that if you want to receive the response to any message sent, unless the DVR delays the response by a second or do, youâ€™ll need to send the subscription request before you send the messages.<br>

The "getConnectedDevices" field will, immidiately after you send the field, send a response as a JSON object with one field, "connectedDevicesList", the key to a value containing a list of all connected devices which you can then subscribe to and send messages to.<br>
